# KNN Classification Practice Project

This is a simple machine learning project built to understand and practice the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm.

## What This Project Does

- Imported and analyzed the dataset
- Processed the features using **StandardScaler**
- Trained a KNN classifier on the scaled data
- Performed error analysis to find the optimal value of **K**
- Evaluated the model with a **confusion matrix** and **classification report**

## Project Purpose

This project was created purely for practice purposes and to get hands-on experience with the KNN algorithm.
